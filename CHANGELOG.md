# Changelog

Releases before v0.1.0 (with the exception of v0.0.6, which had no major changes) were in a previous Github repository, which was taken down due to licensing issues; no changelogs were written for these, but they were very minor.

## v0.1.0
* Allows setting the bot's presence.
* Added Discord.js-inspired collectors for receiving user input.
* Add support for webhooks.
* Allow sending files in messages.
* Added reaction events and getting/creating/deleting reactions.
